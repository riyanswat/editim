A very simple Flask app that converts user-uploaded images to greyscale or changes their format (currently only jpg/webp/png interconversion)... i wrote this code while i was learning [flask from CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVEZYEYctSc)... one of the most amazing tutorials on the internet!!

To run the app, simply run the `main.py` (run `python main.py` in the terminal) and then go to `http://127.0.0.1:5001/` from your browser and thats it!
